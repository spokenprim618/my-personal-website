            I am interested in video games that are challenging and competitive(EX:Rocket League,
            Overwatch, Destiny 2, Splitgate, Halo 5, Gears of War, God Of War, Horizon Zero Dawn,etc). I enjoy drawing robots, monsters, and other animals. I always try to learn new things in coding and the creative aspect is what peeked my interest for it. Below is a character in Overwatch that I play ofter Reinhardt.

        <div id="future">
             A future that I am certain is me in college. Mostly learning computer science and how to better myself. The future that I hope would happen is that I could create a family and be able to see my future generations.
